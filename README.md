Well this is our project of the second semester.
We pretend to be the best work team and that our project to be selected as the best one or even between the best projects.
That was our vision from the first day and that vision makes us overcome all the difficulties later and reach to be between the top 10 best project.

Just fix your vision and pretend to get experience if u really want to take benefits from this very very interesting project.
Please please please take the second semester project seriously because it will really help u to learn more interesting things (technologies, work on team, manage conflicts, have the sense of responsibilites, critic mind and much more interesting things).

Hope that this repository will inspire u.just do not pay a lot of intention to the specifications cause we have exaggerated.
